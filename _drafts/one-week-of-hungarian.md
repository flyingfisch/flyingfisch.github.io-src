Today marks my first ever 7 day streak in DuoLingo. I have attempted to learn Hungarian before, but apparently not for 7 days in a row. During the past week I've learned some basic phrases and greetings, some of the basic grammar for the present tense singular, and I have a general sense of the word order rules. I can now confidently say _én magyar diák vagyok_ (I am a hungarian student). Well, somewhat confidently... _magyar_ is an adjective there and I'm not sure if it works the same as English where it can either mean "I am a student of Hungarian descent" or "I am a student of Hungarian". Perhaps there is more I need to learn in order to say it correctly.

## Things I learned this week about Hungarian

Here are some interesting things I learned this week about Hungarian.

### Word order nuances

Hungarian word order is more flexible than English. However, it's important to realize that this does not mean Hungarian word order doesn't matter. Certain phrases cannot be jumbled. For instance, articles and adjectives seem to always come before the noun they modify, so _te a fiatal fiú látsz_ (you see the young boy) cannot be rephrased as _te fiú a látsz fiatal_. However, the I believe the sentence _can_ be rephrased as _te látsz a fiatal fiú_ to place more emphasis on _látz_ (see). 

Which segues into what happens when you use different word ordering in Hungarian. The two places the main emphasis in a Hungarian sentence is placed are the beginning of the sentence, and directly before the verb. In fact, the focus of words directly before the verb is so strong that it's required for question words like _mi_ (what) to be there. For instance, _mi látsz?_ (what do you see?) can't be rephrased as _látsz mi?_. So when you place a word in a different place in the sentence, you are usually not changing the literal meaning of the sentence, but you are changing the emphasis.

### Unexpected similarities to English

The Hungarian people (Magyars) descended from the Ugrians, a people that lived near the Ural mountains. Some of these people moved west at some point, then later split again with one group, the Finns, going north, and the other group, the Magyars, settling in the Carpathian basin. As a result, the Hungarian language has very little in common with other European languages, it's closest relatives being Khanty and Mansi which are spoken by remaining Uralic tribes to this day. Its closest relatives in Europe are Estonian and Finnish.

The reason I'm leading with that is to demonstrate why I'm surprised when Hungarian has similarities to English, since they are nowhere near each other in the family tree of languages.

## Things I wish I knew earlier

One thing I learned a couple days ago that I wish I knew way earlier is that the DuoLingo _website_ has Hungarian tips which include grammar explanations, etc., but the DuoLingo _mobile app_ only has tips for Spanish, French, and Chinese at the moment. So do yourself a favor and open the website and read the tips before you start a new bubble.

Come on DuoLingo devs, you can do better than that.

## Additional Language Learning Resources

I've been using the following resources in addition to DuoLingo:

* [HungarianReference.com](http://hungarianreference.com/) - though this website looks like it was made in 1999 and has an occasional English typo, it's actually a very good resource for grammar especially.
