Today marks my first ever 7 day streak in DuoLingo. I have attempted to learn Hungarian before, but apparently not for 7 days in a row. During the past week I've learned some basic phrases and greetings, some of the basic grammar for the present tense singular, and I have a general sense of the word order rules.
