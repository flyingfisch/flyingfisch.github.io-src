I've been reading more classic literature lately, and I'm remembering something that has frustrated me since grade school. I don't really know how to put it into words, but if I had to label it I'd say it is exaggeration.

Some examples of this would be Dickens characters, who only seem to come in two varieties: angels and demons. Other examples would be 

Dickens angel or devil characters
Sentences that say how horrible something is as if there was never a bright point ever
