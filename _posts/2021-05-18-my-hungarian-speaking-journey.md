Jó napot!

I have decided to finally make a serious attempt at learning Hungarian. I will be trying to blog in Hungarian occasionally, and then posting the English translation in the second half of the post.

Also, in case anyone is curious, I am using the `Hungarian 101-key` keyboard layout. To set this up in Windows 10, go to `Start > Language Settings`, click `Add preferred language`, and select `Hungarian`. Once the language pack finishes downloading, click the language, then `Options`, and remove the default QWERTZ keyboard. Click `Add a keyboard` and select `Hungarian 101-key, QWERTY`.

You should now be able to switch between English and Hungarian keyboards by using the keyboard switcher in the taskbar.

Viszlát!
