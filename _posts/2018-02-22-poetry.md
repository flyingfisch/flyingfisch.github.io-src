Some poetry I've written in the past couple months.

# Morning

Soft and warm  
The golden paths  
And shadows  
On the carpet.

Quiet footsteps,  
It's morning  
And the baby's  
Still asleep.

# Loss

Milky, fuzzy, sweet and soft  
The odor still remains entombed  
\'Til mother lifting up the cloth  
Escapes the scent into the room.

Nevermore this berth caress  
The child of the morning's ray  
Forever lonesome by its loss  
Youth is snatched and now decay.

# Fallen

The crimson trees have dropped their leaves  
A cool breeze nips his youthful face  
A flock of geese are heading south.

The year is drawing to a close  
Or is the next beginning now  
When spring will come again?

His crimson arm has dropped its sword  
A chilled wind bites his mortal wounds  
Alone the vulture flies above.

His time is drawing to a close  
But soon his next life shall begin  
Where spring will come again.
