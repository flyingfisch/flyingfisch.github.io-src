I recently finished reading my first le Carré novel, *The Spy Who Came In from the Cold*. I really enjoyed the book and decided to read another le Carré spy novel, *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*. While it was relatively easy to read *The Spy Who* without knowing specific spy jargon, *Tinker, Tailor* is proving much more difficult to read without knowing spy terms from the era. I thought it might help other readers if I shared my notes on words that confused me since a lot of them are not in any dictionary and took some digging to find the definitions.

**Resident:** A spy stationed somewhat permanently in a foreign country.

**Lamplighter:** A surveillance agent or courier.

**Pavement artist:** An agent who tracks or follows enemy spies. (An artist at walking the pavement/sidewalk)

**Scalp-hunter:** Secret agents that handle jobs too dirty or risky for agents in the field.

**Burn:** Blackmail.

**The Competition:** MI5, internal counter-espionage. Roughly similar to the American FBI.
