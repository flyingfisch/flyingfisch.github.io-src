I recently finished reading my first le Carré novel, *The Spy Who Came In from the Cold*. I really enjoyed the book and decided to read another le Carré spy novel, *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*. While it was relatively easy to read *The Spy Who* without knowing specific spy jargon, *Tinker, Tailor* is proving much more difficult to read without knowing spy terms from the era. I thought it might help other readers if I shared my notes on words that confused me since a lot of them are not in any dictionary and took some digging to find the definitions.

This is not a complete glossary. Please drop a comment if there are errors or terms that I missed.

***

**Burn:** Blackmail.

**Centre:** KGB. Short for Moscow Centre.

**Circus:** MI6. Fictionally based in Cambridge Circus in the le Carré novels.

**The Competition:** MI5, internal counter-espionage. Roughly similar to the American FBI.

**Funnies:** Spies. Apparently Mendel uses that term [because he is an outsider](https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/26552) and not a member of the Circus himself.

**Hood:** An agent who engages in illegal activity.

**Janitor:** Circus headquarters staff.

**Lamplighter:** A surveillance agent or courier.

**Legman:** An assistant to a secret agent. Someone who plays a supporting role to an agent during a mission. *Note: I couldn't find a definition anywhere for this one so what I have here is a guess based on context.*

**Mother:** Trusted typist or secretary at Circus headquarters.

**Pavement artist:** An agent who tracks or follows enemy spies. (An artist at walking the pavement/sidewalk)

**Pink:** Having Communist sympathies. (Not quite red, but not anti-communist either).

**Resident:** A spy stationed somewhat permanently in a foreign country.

**Scalp-hunter:** Secret agents that handle jobs too dirty or risky for agents in the field.
