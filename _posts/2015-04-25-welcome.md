Welcome to my blog. I am a frontend .NET web developer (mainly ASP.net MVC with C#).
At home I use Linux exclusively and code in Python, Haskell, PHP (with the excellent
[Laravel](http://laravel.org/) framework), or any other language that fits the bill.

I plan to post about programming mainly, but I may also post on other topics as well.
Stay tuned -- or don't (I won't hate you).

## P.S.

"Expositus" is Latin for "open" and "accessible".
